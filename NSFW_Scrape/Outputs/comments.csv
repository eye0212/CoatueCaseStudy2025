I have made some weird ideas and concepts in the last few months that match up to his lyrics in a weird way but I have been listening to that song for years. Soylet stardust time machines would be dangerous, and a time traveler scared out of making a jump might want reassurance to assuage paranoia by leaving such a freaky criss cross of non-volatile permanent information features in the universe although it does allude to loneliness or emptiness which I am mostly immune from unless hungry.

It wasn't on purpose and it is kind of freaky, but it eases my mind about the dangers of time travel, teleporters, and random quantum fluctuations.

‚ÄúRussian forces have been beefing up bases and building military infrastructure near the Finnish border, according to recent satellite imagery, in moves that could reveal their strategy for what happens after the Ukraine war.

The imagery, confirmed by NATO officials, shows row after row of new tents; new warehouses that can store military vehicles; renovations to fighter jet shelters; and steady construction activity on a helicopter base that had been mostly unused and overgrown.

So far the moves seem to be the early stages of a larger, longer-term expansion, and NATO officials say this is nothing like the buildup along the Ukraine border before Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion in 2022. For now, Russia, preoccupied with its war in Ukraine, has very few troops along the frontier, and the Finns insist that none of this is much of a threat ‚Äî yet.

But Finland is one of NATO‚Äôs newest members, joining two years ago, and the moves no doubt reflect Moscow‚Äôs own perception of a threat: This 830-mile frontier is now the Western alliance‚Äôs longest line of contact with Russia. Military analysts predict it could become a hot spot, especially with much of it lying in the increasingly contested Arctic Circle.

Finnish defense officials predict that if the high-intensity phase of the Ukraine war ends ‚Äî one of the goals of the struggling peace efforts unfolding in Turkey ‚Äî Russia will redeploy thousands of troops to the Finnish frontier.

The Finns think they have five years or so before Russia can build up its forces to threatening levels. But they are confident it will happen and that the number of Russian troops facing them will triple.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be talking about so much higher troop levels,‚Äù said Brig. Gen. Pekka Turunen, the director of Finnish defense intelligence.
From Moscow‚Äôs perspective, the Russians need to bolster their defenses to protect themselves from NATO expansion, which has always been a sore subject. The Baltic nations were the first members of the former Soviet Union to join NATO, bringing large stretches of Russia‚Äôs border up against NATO‚Äôs. The prospect of Ukraine, an even bigger former Soviet republic, following suit was so threatening to Moscow that it became one of the causes of the most devastating land war in generations.",1,True,0,486,0.0

LONDON/BRUSSELS, May 19 (Reuters) - Britain agreed the most significant reset of defence and trade ties with the European Union since Brexit on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump's upending of the global order forced the two sides to move on from their acrimonious divorce.

Nearly nine years after it voted to leave the bloc, Britain, a defence heavyweight, will take part in joint procurement projects. The sides also agreed to make it easier for UK food and visitors to reach the EU, and signed a contentious new fishing deal.

The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here.

Trump's tariffs, alongside warnings that Europe should do more to protect itself, forced governments around the world to rethink trade, defence and security ties, bringing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer closer to France's Emmanuel Macron and other European leaders.

Starmer, who backed remaining in the EU in the Brexit referendum, also bet that offering tangible benefits to Britons such as the use of faster e-gates at EU airports will drown out the cries of ""betrayal"" from Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage.

The government said the reset with its biggest trading partner would reduce red tape for food and agricultural producers, making food cheaper, improve energy security and add nearly 9 billion pounds ($12.1 billion) to the economy by 2040.

It is the third deal Britain has struck this month, after agreements with India and the U.S., and while it is unlikely to lead to a meaningful economic boost immediately it could lift corporate sentiment, drawing much-needed investment.

""It's time to look forward,"" Starmer said in a statement. ""To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people.

""We're ready to work with partners if it means we can improve people‚Äôs lives here at home.""

At the heart of the reset is a defence and security pact that will let Britain be part of any joint procurement and pave the way for British companies including BAE (BAES.L), opens new tab, Rolls-Royce (RR.L), opens new tab and Babcock (BAB.L), opens new tab to take part in a 150 billion euro ($167 billion) programme to rearm Europe.

On fishing, British and EU vessels will have access to each other's waters for 12 years - removing one of the UK's strongest hands in any future talks - in return for a permanent reduction in paperwork and border checks that had prevented small food producers from exporting to Europe.

In return, Britain has agreed to the outline of a limited youth mobility scheme, with the details to be hammered out in future, and it is discussing participation in the Erasmus+ student exchange programme.

The agreement was denounced by Farage and the opposition Conservative Party, which was in power when Britain left the bloc and spent years negotiating the original divorce deal.",1,True,0,509,0.0

1kpqmqi,mt0zi8p,"&gt;As millions of Poles vote today in the¬†first round of presidential elections, Ukraine‚Äôs intelligence services have issued a warning over Russian attempts to exploit the event to spread disinformation and weaken Poland‚Äôs internal unity.

&gt;‚ÄúThe Kremlin has activated a special operation \[called\] Doppelganger in the midst of elections in Poland,‚Äù wrote Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (DIU), the Ukrainian government‚Äôs military intelligence service, in a message on Telegram on Sunday morning, after voting had already begun.

&gt;DIU described the operation as ‚Äúanother phase of the information war against European society‚Äù and said that Doppelganger ‚Äúis one of Russia‚Äôs largest and longest-running information campaigns aimed at EU and NATO countries‚Äù.

&gt;The intelligence agency said that, as part of its efforts, Russia has created websites and social media accounts that imitate genuine Western media and are used to ‚Äúspread disinformation under the guise of real news‚Äù, though it did not provide examples of such counterfeit sites.

&gt;It added that social media platform X, in particular, had been used since March this year to spread ‚Äúfalse and manipulative messages‚Äù through accounts imitating real voters that are amplified by so-called bot farms.

&gt;The main types of messages spread by the operation are ‚Äúcriticism of Poland‚Äôs support for Ukraine, calls for the country to leave the European Union, and discrediting of the policies of \[Polish Prime Minister\] Donald Tusk‚Äôs government‚Äù, said the DIU.

&gt;‚ÄúAt the same time, pro-Russian media outlets are shaping a negative image of Ukraine, calling it the main factor in the ‚Äòchaos‚Äô in Polish politics,‚Äù added the agency. ‚ÄúSuch actions are part of a broader strategy of Moscow‚Äôs hybrid pressure on the EU and NATO countries, aimed at weakening their internal unity.‚Äù

&gt;Last week, Poland‚Äôs digital affairs minister, Krzysztof Gawkowski,¬†said¬†that ‚Äúwe are facing an unprecedented attempt by Russia to interfere in the Polish elections‚Äù. He claimed that the campaigns of¬†all candidates¬†standing in today‚Äôs election had been targeted by Russian attacks.

&gt;On Friday, just before Poland entered ‚Äúelection silence‚Äù over the weekend, during which campaigning and even publishing opinion polls is prohibited, Tusk said that three of the parties in his ruling coalition, including his own Civic Platform (PO), had been¬†targeted in an attack by Russian hackers.

&gt;More broadly, over the last two years Poland has been targeted by a¬†campaign of online and real-life sabotage¬†‚Äì including a series of¬†arson attacks¬†‚Äì that it has blamed on operatives working on behalf of Russia.

&gt;Hard-right nationalist¬†George Simion, 38, who opposes military aid to neighboring Ukraine and is critical of European Union leadership, decisively swept the first presidential election round, triggering the collapse of a pro-Western coalition government. That led to significant capital outflows.¬†

&gt;Centrist Bucharest mayor¬†Nicu»ôor Dan, 55, who has pledged to clamp down on corruption, is staunchly pro-EU and NATO, and has said Romania's support for Ukraine is vital for its own security against a growing Russian threat.¬†

&gt;The president of the EU and NATO state has considerable powers, not least being in charge of the defense council that decides on military aid. He will also have oversight of foreign policy, with the power to veto EU votes that require unanimity.¬†

&gt;Whoever is elected will also need to nominate a prime minister to negotiate a new majority in parliament to reduce Romania's budget deficit - the largest in the EU - as well as reassure investors and try to avoid a credit rating downgrade.

&gt;**‚ÄòWe cannot afford to drift‚Äô**¬†

&gt;An opinion poll on Friday showed¬†Dan slightly ahead of Simion¬†for the first time since the first round in a tight race that will depend on turnout and the sizable Romanian diaspora.¬†

In *Orellana v. Roblox*, a mom sued Epic, Sony, Roblox, and Apple because her kids were ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to Fortnite and Roblox. The court? It mostly focused on whether the kids clicked ‚ÄúI accept‚Äù on the TOS (which included arbitration clauses)‚Ä¶ and boom, most of the case gets sent to private arbitration.

But the kids are minors? Doesn‚Äôt matter. They clicked ‚Äúaccept,‚Äù so it counts ‚Äî even if it was in 8pt font on a grey background.

Honestly, I‚Äôve got two thoughts:

1. **Parents: read what your kids are signing up for.**
2. **Game companies: stop pretending that a 12-year-old clicking a button is informed legal consent.**

The kicker? The only kid who *didn‚Äôt* get forced into arbitration is the one who **never played Fortnite**. üòÇ

Todd Howard is still at the helm - and maybe that is the problem. What held Starfield (Bethesda) back is lack of innovation. Nothing really set the game apart from other similar space or RPG titles. 

Feels like Bethesda is running on a formulaic system that has been traditionally safe for them. However in the 2025, their tech is being stale and outdated. The NPCs Bethesda has to populate its worlds are wooden and flat. 

Modern, successful titles have utilized motion capture for immersive dialogues and scenes- it seems that Starfields (Bethesda in general) does not do this, I only know of them using MoCap for things like movement animations for in game characters.

1koq2wl,msrzfdf,"A debate as old as time.

The reality is that JRPGs and choice based RPGs developed in the west still share a common origin in the late 70s and 80s computer dungeon crawlers. Western RPGs went on to focus more and more on replicating aspects of tabletop role playing (choices and consequences as well as general freedom) while JRPGs evolved into pretty linear stories with fully realized pre-defined characters.

The fact that WRPGs are so heavily scrutinized by fans today when they are perceived as lacking meaningful choices while that issue doesn't even cross the mind of JRPG fans just shows how much the audience and expectations for the two have diverged (this is without even going into the tonal differences between the two). For the latter, RPG basically just means character stats, leveling systems, resource management and all those mechanics that the former would argue are only here to enrich the actual role playing experience.  

As someone who is more of a JRPG person, I have to admit that lumping them in the same category can feel rather off. Clair Obscur and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will most likely be competing for the same ""Best Role Playing Game"" trophy come award seasons and the fact that a game with one of the most dynamic choice/consequences story campaign might very well lose to one that almost has none of that is a bit of a shame.",1,False,0,238,0.0

You‚Äôre looking at two cartridges for The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS. Upon closer inspection, one of them appears to be a fake, while the other looks more likely to be legitimate.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the differences and what they suggest:

‚∏ª

Left Cartridge (likely real):

‚úÖ Print Quality: Clearer, with crisp colors and clean text.
‚úÖ Label Alignment: Well-aligned, evenly cut.
‚úÖ Official Logos: ‚ÄúOriginal Nintendo Seal of Quality‚Äù and CE mark look accurate.
‚úÖ Color Tone: The background is the correct light blue map design used on original PAL versions.

‚∏ª

Right Cartridge (likely fake):

‚ùå Print Quality: Noticeably worse; washed out, blurry text and colors.
‚ùå Character Art: Link and Ciela (the fairy) look lower-resolution and poorly colored.
‚ùå Label Color: Off-white and inconsistent with the official release.
‚ùå Ink Smudging: Some ink bleed or poor print consistency is visible.
‚ùå Nintendo Logo: The font seems slightly off and not as clean.

‚∏ª

Extra Tip to Confirm:

If you have the cartridges physically:
	‚Ä¢	Look at the back of the cartridge. Genuine Nintendo DS cartridges will have a unique code engraved in the plastic (like ‚ÄúNTR-005 PAT. PEND.‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	You can also compare the board by opening it carefully‚Äîfake cartridges usually have cheaper, non-Nintendo PCBs inside.

‚∏ª

Verdict:
	‚Ä¢	Left Cartridge = Likely Legit
	‚Ä¢	Right Cartridge = Likely Fake

The thing is, actual rates of consumption weren't any different between religious and nonreligious porn-watchers. The difference was that the religious users felt bad about it; porn was ""problematic"" because they or those around them said it was a problem.

I wonder, if you drill down into the various subcategories of ""problematic use"" of drugs, how much of the difference is simply from the lifting of psychological depression due to guilt or shame at breaking the law; if it's legal, there's nothing to feel guilty about.",1,False,0,132,0.0

1khwwfm,mraaose,"&gt;Some plants stink of rotting meat or dung, which helps them attract flies for pollination. How plants make the carrion stench, which is usually produced by bacteria feasting on decaying corpses, has been a mystery until now.

&gt;Several types of plants have independently evolved to make the fetid odor thanks to a few¬†[tweaks in one gene](http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8988), researchers report May 8 in¬†*Science*.

&gt;Scientists in Japan used biochemistry and molecular and evolutionary genetics to determine that three unrelated plant lineages hit on the same evolutionary trick to produce the smell. First, a gene called¬†*SBP1*¬†was duplicated. (Gene duplication is a pretty common occurrence in the evolution of most organisms, including¬†[humans](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-human-pangenome-biology-dna-diversity).) Then the extra copy of the gene mutated, swapping a few amino acids in the enzyme it produces.

&gt;In a type of wild ginger (*Asarum simile)*¬†and the East Asian eurya shrub (*Eurya japonica)*, three changes were needed to bring the stink that these plants and some of their relatives share. But the Asian skunk cabbage (*Symplocarpus renifolius*) needed only two amino acid swaps to become malodorous.

The mask analyzes a person's breath to look for gases that are associated with kidney disease, researchers said.

But scientists [studying](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08958-4) the behaviour of starlings have found their ability to give and take makes their relationships closer to human friendships than previously thought.

About 10% of bird species and 5% of mammal species breed ‚Äúcooperatively‚Äù, meaning some individuals refrain from breeding to help others care for their offspring. Some species even help those they are unrelated to.

Now researchers studying superb starlings have found the support cuts both ways, with birds that received help in feeding or guarding their chicks returning the favour when the ‚Äúhelper‚Äù bird has offspring of its own.

Prof Dustin Rubenstein, a co-author of the study from the University of Colombia, said such behaviour was probably necessary for superb starlings as they live in a harsh environment where drought is common and food is limited.

‚ÄúTwo birds probably can‚Äôt feed their offspring on their own, so they need these helpers to help them,‚Äù he said, adding that as each breeding pair produces few offspring, birds must be recruited from outside the family group to help the young survive.

‚ÄúWhat happens is the non-relatives come into the group, and they breed pretty quickly, usually in the first year, maybe the second year, and then they take some time off and some of the other birds breed ‚Äì and we never understood why,‚Äù said Rubenstein. ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre forming these pairwise reciprocal relationships, in the sense that I might help you this year, and then you‚Äôll help me in the future.‚Äù",1,True,0,271,0.0

1khql7o,mr93oou,"I mean... how else would you defend though when you claim the sex was consensual other than stating that (which is 'she asked for it' or 'unclear no' in some way I guess)? If you have no violence involved specifically, it becomes really hard to tell with medical evidence. Then you are just relying on testimony by the 2 people involved who both might have various reasons for lying or there really was a miscommunication which sadly led to unwanted outcomes. One of the examples they give as a problematic rape myth is to argue for consent if the girl initiates sexual acts before actual sex after taking the supposed rapist into a room by her own and possibly having a history of doing so. Maybe I'm really not seeing it but that seems like a reasonable doubt to bring up in a rape trial?

The solution the researchers presented was thus to basically disallow any of those 'myths' in court cases so you can't claim she didn't clearly say no, can't claim it was consensual, can't do a typical thing like bringing the character of perp and victim into play etc. That just seems pretty wild to me.",1,False,0,199,0.0

From the linked article: 

Men with lifelong premature ejaculation show higher impulsivity and psychological distress, study finds

Men with lifelong premature ejaculation tend to score higher on measures of impulsivity, suggesting that difficulties with self-control may contribute to the severity of this common sexual dysfunction. The findings, published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, also indicate that depression and anxiety are more prevalent among affected individuals, highlighting the complex psychological dimensions of the condition.

Premature ejaculation is the most frequently reported sexual dysfunction in men and is typically defined as ejaculation that occurs earlier than desired‚Äîoften within one minute of vaginal penetration. While treatments and explanations for the condition have varied, researchers have long debated whether psychological, neurobiological, or relational factors are primarily to blame. The current study aimed to better understand how impulse control might relate to the severity of premature ejaculation, particularly among men with lifelong symptoms.

The researchers found that men with premature ejaculation scored significantly lower on the Arabic Index of Premature Ejaculation, indicating more severe symptoms. These men also had consistently higher scores across all measures of impulsivity. On the UPPS scale, they exhibited greater urgency, poorer planning, more sensation-seeking, and less perseverance compared to the control group. Similarly, scores on the Barratt scale revealed higher levels of motor impulsiveness, attentional impulsiveness, and poor planning.

Notably, anxiety and depression scores were also elevated among men with premature ejaculation. On average, they scored roughly six times higher on measures of depression and nearly five times higher on anxiety compared to the control group. While the study could not determine whether these psychological symptoms caused premature ejaculation or resulted from it, the data suggest a strong connection between the two.

The researchers also explored how varying levels of premature ejaculation severity might be linked to different psychological profiles. They divided the men with premature ejaculation into four subgroups: those who ejaculated before penetration (precoital), within 15 seconds after penetration, within 15 to 30 seconds, and within 30 to 60 seconds. Across these categories, those with the shortest ejaculation times tended to score highest on impulsivity measures, particularly in the areas of urgency and motor impulsiveness. These individuals also showed more sensation-seeking behavior and lower persistence, suggesting a potential relationship between low self-control and extremely rapid ejaculation.

Interestingly, while depression and anxiety were more common in the premature ejaculation group as a whole, they did not vary much between subgroups based on ejaculation time. This suggests that while mood disorders may be common among men with premature ejaculation, they are not necessarily tied to how quickly ejaculation occurs. In contrast, the different levels of impulsivity showed a clear association with shorter ejaculation times.",1,True,0,488,0.0

From the linked article: 

Global study finds political left more trusting of climate scientists than right

A sweeping 26-country study reveals a consistent gap in trust toward climate scientists based on political ideology, with right-leaning individuals reporting lower trust than their left-leaning counterparts. The divide is especially stark in wealthier democracies and English-speaking nations, according to the research, published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology (link is external and opens in a new window).

Analyzing survey data from 10,641 participants across 26 nations, researchers found political ideology significantly influences trust in climate scientists‚Äîwith a few exceptions. While right-leaning individuals showed lower trust in 22 countries, the pattern reversed in China and Indonesia, where left-leaning respondents were more skeptical. In Egypt and Georgia, political views made no difference, suggesting climate change remains less politicized in these regions. On average, participants identified as politically centrist.

The link between political views and distrust of climate scientists was strongest in wealthier, more democratic countries with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers call this the ‚Äúpost-industrial paradox‚Äù‚Äîas nations develop, some people may see science as less essential to progress, making them more skeptical. In democracies, political divides can deepen this distrust. High-emitting countries also face well-funded misinformation campaigns, often from fossil fuel interests, that undermine trust in climate science.",1,True,0,262,0.0

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02117-5

Abstract

Sleep is thought to play a critical role in the retention of memory for past experiences (episodic memory), reducing the rate of forgetting compared with wakefulness. Yet it remains unclear whether and how sleep actively transforms the way we remember multidimensional real-world experiences, and how such memory transformation unfolds over the days, months and years that follow. In an exception to the law of forgetting, we show that sleep actively and selectively improves the accuracy of memory for a one-time, real-world experience (an art tour)‚Äîspecifically boosting memory for the order of tour items (sequential associations) versus perceptual details from the tour (featural associations). This above-baseline boost in sequence memory was not evident after a matched period of wakefulness. Moreover, the preferential retention of sequence relative to featural memory observed after a night‚Äôs sleep grew over time up to 1‚Äâyear post-encoding. Finally, overnight polysomnography showed that sleep-related memory enhancement was associated with the duration and neurophysiological hallmarks of slow-wave sleep previously linked to sequential neural replay, particularly spindle‚Äìslow wave coupling. These results suggest that sleep serves a crucial and selective role in enhancing sequential organization in our memory for past events at the expense of perceptual details, linking sleep-related neural mechanisms to the days-to-years-long transformation of memory for complex real-life experiences.

From the linked article: 

A new study published in Nature Human Behaviour suggests that sleep doesn‚Äôt just protect memories from fading‚Äîit transforms them. Researchers found that sleep selectively strengthens memory for the sequence of real-world events while allowing many of the perceptual details to fade. This transformation wasn‚Äôt short-lived: even 15 months after a one-time event, people better remembered the order in which things occurred‚Äîif they had slept soon after the experience.

The study addresses a long-standing question in memory research: does sleep simply preserve memories by protecting them from interference, or does it actively enhance and reshape them? Previous studies have shown that sleeping after learning improves memory, but many of those studies used artificial tasks like memorizing word lists or images on a screen. Researchers working in Brian Levine‚Äôs research lab at Baycrest‚Äôs Rotman Research Institute took a different approach by examining memory for a real-world experience and tracking how it changed over time‚Äîdays, weeks, and even more than a year later.

While overall memory accuracy declined over time, people consistently remembered the order of events better than the specific details if they had gotten a full night‚Äôs sleep. In contrast, those who stayed awake during the same post-learning period showed no such advantage. In fact, only the sleep group demonstrated an actual improvement in sequence memory from before to after sleep, a rare finding that runs counter to the typical trend of gradual memory decay.",1,True,0,515,0.0
1kgy3mm,mr2l7wj,"People who have experienced a recent acute mental or emotional trauma are being encouraged to play tetris and avoid sleeping for a minimum of several hours afterwards to reduce the traumatic effects. Dreaming about the trauma reinforces the memory. 

Loading in new unrelated memories seems to attenuate the traumatic experience by shoving it to the back of the line for sleep processing.

You get to be the CEO of a large company with the private entrance to your spacious office, which is generally cut off from the rest of the building so the unwashed masses can't accidentally find their way in without being summoned... you start to lose touch with reality. The only people you ever talk to are the yes-men/women in the C-suite with you and other CEOs at different companies. One of them starts thinking that being the CEO of a large company automatically means they're so much smarter than everyone else (\*cough\* Xitler \*cough\*) and it makes you a prime target for some kind of cult. 

I forget all the fads, but look at what Bill Gates did with Microsoft in the early 2000s... *Everything* Microsoft made had to have some kind of Internet related feature to it, Didn't matter if it made sense, they had to find some way to shoehorn it in. Ballmer did the same thing trying to chase the iPhone and Android. There was some fad after that which elides me ATM, but then last decade everyone was obsessed with blockchain/Web3. Everything had to have blockchain, despite the fact that most people hyping it had no idea what it was, what it was good for, or what it wasn't good for, and when people tried to actually implement it, it all went sideways real fast. 

Now the big fad is AI, despite the fact that it's still probably a good 10+ years from being ready. Everyone pictures this Star Trek computer-like system which can process natural language and handle complex queries, but the reality is what we have is basically as good as it gets. You want it to churn out a cliffs notes version of some long bit of text, it's great for that. You want it to crank out a bunch of middling quality templates for common documents, it can do that too. You want it to spout a bunch of Nazi propaganda, Xitler has an AI for you!

1kpu7yy,mt23ky2,"&gt;I don't understand why these illiterate hillbillies are hellbent on wanting low skill, low value jobs instead of going to school and learning valuable skills.

Because the educational system has been a train wreck for decades.  Students aren't taught to learn, they're taught to memorize.  They're not taught to think, they're taught to remember.  They aren't passed based on what they've learned, they're passed based on what they've memorized.  And the schools themselves have to maintain a minimum success rate in order to retain funding, so students who *should* be held back are shuffled to the next grade level.

Teachers typically aren't given sufficient resources or time to *actually* teach, either.  Many of them go into the field with bright eyes and high hopes, and rapidly discover that they're trying to shape the minds of 30-60 children per class, 5-8 classes per day, with scarcely 50 minutes for each class.  There's no *time* for them to work individually with students, to shore up their weak points, to encourage their strong points, to push them to excel, so they inevitably fall back on stale, dull, rote methods that generalize the educational process to such a degree that the students who struggle never catch up, and the students who breeze through never feel challenged... or rewarded.

This has created multiple generations of people who believe that learning is either *too hard*, or *too boring*.  The slower ones don't want to learn because they were never taught to think, only to repeat.  The faster ones want to learn, but all they've seen is tedious, easy garbage that they don't even have to think about, so they ignore it.  And they become trapped in that, stuck in dead-end, low-paying jobs that grind their bodies to paste while they dream of something better, but never pursue it because the one thing they did learn from their journey through the education system was that *it wasn't worth it*.

1koxvl8,mstm7kt,"Some of the more interesting parts of this piece:

&gt;The crowded room in Westport was reflective of the broad concern about the effect that social media may have on children and teenagers. But it was also a very specific expression of it. Explaining the impetus for hosting the marketplace, Becca Zipkin, a co-founder of the Westport branch of OK to Delay, told me that it has become the standard for kids in the area to receive an iPhone as an elementary-school graduation present. One of her group‚Äôs goals is to push back on this ritual and create a different culture in their community. ‚ÄúThis is not a world in which there are no options,‚Äù she said.
&gt;
&gt;The options on display in Westport were more interesting than I‚Äôd thought they were going to be. They reflected the tricky balancing act parents face: how to let kids enjoy the benefits of being connected (a chess game, a video call with Grandma, a GPS route to soccer practice, the feeling of autonomy that comes from setting a photo of Olivia Rodrigo as your home-screen background) and protect them from the bad stuff (violent videos, messages from creeps, the urge to endlessly scroll, the ability to see where all of your friends are at any given time and therefore be aware every time you‚Äôre excluded).
&gt;
&gt;Pinwheel, an Austin-based company, demonstrated one solution with a custom operating system for Android phones such as the Google Pixel that allows parents to receive alerts for ‚Äútrigger words‚Äù received in their kids‚Äô texts, and lets them read every message at any time. As with most of the others demonstrated at the fair, Pinwheel‚Äôs custom app store made it impossible for kids to install social media. During the demo, I saw that Pinwheel also blocked a wide range of other apps, including Spotify‚Äîthe booth attendant told me and a nearby mom that the app contains ‚Äúunlimited porn,‚Äù a pronouncement that surprised both of us. (According to him, kids put links to porn in playlist descriptions; I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true, but Spotify did have a brief problem with porn appearing in a small number of search results last year.) The app for the arts-and-crafts chain Michaels was also blocked, for a similar but less explicit reason: A red label placed on the Michaels app advised that it may contain a loophole that would allow kids to get onto unnamed other platforms. (Michaels didn‚Äôt respond to my request for comment, and Spotify declined comment.)
&gt;
&gt;Beyond the standard suite of surveillance tools, many of the devices are also outfitted with AI-powered tools that would preemptively censor content on kids‚Äô phones: Nudity would be blurred out and trigger an alert sent to a parent, for instance; a kid receiving a text from a friend with a potty mouth would see only a series of asterisks instead of expletives.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Although everybody at the library was enormously polite, there is apparently hot competition in the alternative-device space. Troomi, for instance, markets itself as a ‚Äúsmarter, safer alternative to Pinwheel.‚Äù Pinwheel‚Äôs website emphasizes that its AI chatbot, PinwheelGPT, is a more useful tool than Troomi‚Äôs chatbot, Troodi‚Äîwhich Pinwheel argues is emotionally confusing for children, because the bot is anthropomorphized in the form of a cartoon woman. Bark provides pages comparing each of these competitors, unfavorably, with its own offering.
&gt;
&gt;Afterward, Zipkin told me that parents had given her varied feedback on the different devices. Some of them felt that the granular level of monitoring texts for any sign of emotional distress or experimental cursing was over-the-top and invasive. Others were impressed, as she was, with some of the AI features that seem to take a bit of the load off of parents who are tired of constant vigilance. Despite all the negative things she‚Äôd personally heard about artificial intelligence, this seemed to her like a way it could be used for good. ‚ÄúKnowing that your kids won‚Äôt receive harassing or bullying material or sexual images or explicit images, or anything like that, is extremely attractive as a parent,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúKnowing that there‚Äôs technology to block that is, I think, amazing.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;Of course, as every parent knows, no system is actually going to block every single dangerous, gross, or hurtful thing that can come in through a phone from the outside world. But that there are now so many alternative-device companies to choose from is evidence of how much people want and are willing to search for something that has so far been unattainable: a phone without any of the bad stuff.

It's interesting to see this ecosystem pop up that is looking to meet the needs of people who are concerned about various aspects of their connected devices and lives (and that of their children). However, it seems that these companies might be missing the forest for the trees. Sometimes it's not 'better' tech that people need, but rather less tech along with more tech and media savvy.",1,True,0,866,0.0
