1kqb6vj,gaming,1747659914.0,I love that Death Stranding made a superhero out of a deliveryman,"
As a former deliveryman, one of the reasons Death Stranding became my favorite is because Kojima made a superhero out of one of the most ""basic"" jobs.

Basic is in quotes because if you've ever delivered you know there's nothing basic about driving a box truck, using a forklift to take down pallets and navigating an electric pallet jack in store without destroying everything. 

Since you can finish deliveries for other players it actually makes an impact on the real world, too.  That sense of accomplishment from a solid day of manual labor shines through, just a bit, in Death Stranding. 

And an honest days hard work is one of the best feelings in the world, imo.

I mainly play battlefield because it just doesn't get boring for me. She's not into it which is completely understandable but I like gaming with her so we try all these different games, play them a tonne and then get bored. 

The only shooter I can really play with her is fortnite but I can't stand the game. Admittedly I enjoyed the past couple of seasons but the newer ones are a letdown and I only play because it means we can play.

&gt;""We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game,"" the team said in a statement. ""This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred.
&gt;""We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to [the artist] to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist. As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.
&gt;""To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions. We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.""

It's Gears of War, it's the one time men can cry, and no one judges you. 

It's Gears of War brother, just remember Dom's lucky knife. He always keeps it with him, he got it from his older brother who sadly died. He gives it to Marcus when visiting the uh....graves. I won't explain more, just know that knife is very important and gets passed down to Marcus' son who uses it in Gears of War 4 and 5. Also, when he hands Marcus that knife, get ready to cry the manliest tears a man has ever cried. It's tradition.

Just be aware that every time you say ""FUCK YEAH!"" or ""WOO!"" Gears of War tallies in and makes you pay the debt later. The data is cross saved too so each install counts your excitement just to rip it away in the most painful way possible. So yeah cry all you want, it's fine. ",False

1knz2pd,gaming,1747396885.0,Switch 2 expensive not because of tariffs.,"So, I just wanted to throw this out there. According to an article by TechRadar. Nintendo isn't making consoles more expensive due to tariffs, it's because they expect ""low sales"". 

I'm no doctor, but I'm calling shenanigans. This seems a little off considering the Switch sold 152.12 million systems.(pulled from Nintendo's page). Are they expecting a Wii U fiasco again? If that's the case, why even consider releasing a system knowing it'll under perform?

Long story short, if you're expecting to under sell, charging more isn't doing your console any favors.
