## üîç Coverage Analysis

### Subreddit Coverage
- **Sampled**: 245 subreddits
- **Reddit Total**: ~100,000 active subreddits
- **Coverage**: 0.24% of Reddit's active subreddits

### Activity Coverage
- **Collected**: 13,396 activities
- **Reddit Daily**: ~1,000,000 activities
- **Coverage**: 1.34% of Reddit's daily activities

### Author Coverage
- **Found**: 8,669 unique authors
- **Reddit DAU**: 73,100,000 users
- **Coverage**: 0.01% of Reddit's DAU

## üéØ Calibration Methodology

### Approach
The system uses **author-based proxies** as a stable measure of Reddit's true engagement:

1. **Collect Raw Proxies**: Count unique authors posting/commenting
2. **Calculate Coverage**: Determine what fraction of Reddit we're sampling
3. **Apply Calibration**: Scale up to Reddit's total user base
4. **Validate Accuracy**: Compare to Reddit's disclosed metrics

### Calibration Formula
```
k_dau = Reddit_DAU / Our_DAU‚Ä≤
k_dau = 73,100,000 / 8,669 = 8,432.35

Calibrated_DAU = DAU‚Ä≤ √ó k_dau
Calibrated_DAU = 8,669 √ó 8,432.35 = 73,100,000
```
